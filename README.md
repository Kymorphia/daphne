An advanced audio player written in [D](https://www.dlang.org) using [giD](https://gid.dub.pm).

This project started as a showcase of giD but intends to be an awesome audio player and music library organizer.

DAPHNE stands for D Audio Player Helping Navigate the Elements.
Also a reference to the Greek myth and Daphne the nymph.
